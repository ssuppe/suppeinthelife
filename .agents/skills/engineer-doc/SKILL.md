# Engineer Doc

Analyze the recent session history and code changes to ensure all documentation is up to date.

### Context
1. Read `README.md`.
2. Scan `docs/` (pm, design, eng).

### Task
1. Identify any new features, architectural decisions, or UX changes that aren't yet documented.
2. Update `README.md` if the project overview or setup has changed.
3. Update relevant files in `docs/` to reflect the "as-built" state.
4. Ensure the `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (or equivalent) reflects completed tasks.
